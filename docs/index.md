# KWAI
> The sports club management system.

KWAI is a project for managing a sports club.

!!! note
    KWAI is a work in progress. The current focus is judo, therefore the name KWAI which means club in Japanese.
    Our judo club is already using it for managing the website with news, pages and trainings.

The system can be divided in two parts: a backend and a frontend.

## Backend
Unlike the [other version](https://github.com/fbraem/kwai-api) which was written in PHP, this backend is written in
Python and uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as web framework to provide an API for Kwai.

[Backend documentation](./kwai-backend/index.md)

## Frontend
The frontend consists of several single page applications. [Vue](https://vuejs.org) is used as JavaScript framework.
