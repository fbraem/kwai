# KWAI
> The sports club management system.

## Frontend
The frontend consists of several single page applications. [Vue](https://vuejs.org) is used as JavaScript framework. 
Currently, the source code is still located in a separate repository: [kwai-vite](https://github.com/fbraem/kwai-vite). 
Eventually that code will be moved to this repository.

## Backend
Unlike the [other version](https://github.com/fbraem/kwai-api) which is written in PHP, this backend is written in 
Python and uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as web framework to provide an API for Kwai.
