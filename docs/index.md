# KWAI
> The sports club management system.


## Backend
Unlike the [other version](https://github.com/fbraem/kwai-api) which is written in PHP, this backend is written in 
Python and uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as web framework to provide an API for Kwai.

[Backend documentation](./kwai-backend/index.md)

## Frontend
The frontend consists of several single page applications. [Vue](https://vuejs.org) is used as JavaScript framework.
