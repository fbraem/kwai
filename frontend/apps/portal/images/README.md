Images
======

This folder contains images that are used in the portal application.
There is no need to put these images in git as they may be different for each website.

Hero
----
A hero image is used as background of the hero section. Be sure to include at
least `hero.jpg`. Each application can have its own hero image. A hero image for
an application is named as `hero_<application>.jpg`. For example: `hero_news.jpg` will
be used as hero image for the news application.
