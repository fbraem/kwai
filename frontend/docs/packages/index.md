# Kwai Frontend Packages

The packages folder contains code that can be reused in several applications.
Those packages can be typescript modules, configuration settings, ...

## eslint-config-kwai

## kwai-api

## kwai-config

## kwai-date

## kwai-types

## kwai-ui

This package contains reusable Vue components.

> Some of the components are just wrappers of [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org) components. This makes sure the
> applications are not depending directly on PrimeVue. If, for some reason, PrimeVue needs to be replaced or PrimeVue
> contains a breaking change, we only need to change the wrappers.
