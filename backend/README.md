The kwai backend provides an api for kwai. All server side code is written
with Python. The web framework used is [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is used to generate the [documentation](https://fbraem.github.io/kwai/). 
Currently, this is a work in progress...
