# Kwai Backend

The kwai backend provides an api for kwai. All server side code is written
with Python. The web framework used is [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) will be used to generate the [documentation](./docs/index.md). 
Currently, this is a work in progress...
