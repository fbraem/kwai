# Kwai

> This project is moved to Codeberg: [https://codeberg.org/zumuta/kwai](https://codeberg.org/zumuta/kwai).

This repository is (again) a greenfield project: a monorepo containing the source code for the frontend and
the backend of Kwai. Someday, Kwai will be a (sport) club management system.

The system is written following DDD as software development philosophy. Clean code should be the result of following
this philosophy.

## Documentation
The documentation, for backend and frontend, is generated by mkdocs and can be read
[here](https://kwai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
